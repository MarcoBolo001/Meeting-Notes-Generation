Summary:
The meeting began with an intent to return to a prior presentation, quickly transitioning to discussing key fund transfer consent items identified as Items 23 and 24. Discussion on Item 23 highlighted a communication from Councilwoman Mango recommending an appropriation increase of $1,000 to support the Long Beach Lesbian and Gay Pride Inc. for the upcoming 2022 Pride Parade and Festival. In tandem, Item 24 introduced by Vice Mayor Richardson, alongside Councilwomen Sunday and Allen, proposed increasing appropriations by $50,000 to aid the Uptown Jazz Festival's execution. 

Following the discussions, a request for a motion and subsequent second led to Speaker 3 and Councilman Richardson stepping forward. The floor was then opened for public comments, specifically targeting the aforementioned items, conducting outreach for both in-person and Zoom participants. The absence of public commentary prompted the meeting to proceed to a roll-call vote. 

All districts, from one through nine, unanimously supported the motions, achieving a nine to zero vote in favor of the fund transfers for both events. This approval underscores the Council's unified support for community-focused initiatives, showcasing a strong endorsement for cultural and inclusivity programs within the Long Beach area.

The meeting was concluded with the announcement of progression to two specific commission appointment items and general public comments, signifying the Council's continued dedication to addressing various agenda items in service of the public and local community.

Notes:
- The meeting underscored the importance of supporting local cultural events, highlighting the Council's commitment to inclusivity and community engagement.
- The unanimous vote illustrated a cohesive vision among council members for funding cultural and community events.
- The procedural aspects of the meeting, from presentation re-visitations to public comments and voting, were adhered to, showcasing well-structured governance.
- Attendance by both council members and the public (though virtual participants were not explicitly noted speaking) emphasizes the role of civic engagement in municipal governance.
