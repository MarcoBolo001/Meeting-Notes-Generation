**Summary:**
During the meeting held by the Seattle City Council on September 6, 2016, members discussed and deliberated on the acceptance of funding from non-city sources for various city departments. The meeting kicked off with Speaker 1 presenting a report from the Affordable Housing Neighborhoods and Finance Committee. The ordinance discussed aimed to authorize the acceptance of funding for the year 2016 from external sources. It was emphasized that this funding would enable the heads of various departments including the Executive Department, Department of Parks and Recreation, Human Services Department, Seattle Fire Department, Seattle Police Department, Legislative Department, and Seattle Public Utilities to accept specified grants. Furthermore, it would allow for the execution, delivery, and performance of corresponding agreements while also ratifying and confirming certain prior acts. Speaker 4 shed light on this being the second grant acceptance ordinance of 2016, detailing that it would facilitate city departments in accepting nearly $4 million of external support for a range of projects. Notable grants included $1.9 million from the Washington State Department of Commerce directed to the Department of Parks and Recreation to support the Urban Forestry, Green Seattle Partnership, and $500,000 from the King County Flood Control District to Seattle Public Utilities. This funding from King County serves as the initial installment of a cumulative $4 million in flood control project funding spanning from 2016 to 2020. After the discussion, the bill was put to a vote, where it passed unanimously with eight votes in favor. The successful passage of this bill signifies the city's commitment to enhancing its services and infrastructure through external financial support.

**Notes:**
- The unanimous vote underscores the council's collective agreement on the importance of accepting external grants for city enhancement projects.
- The role of the Seattle City Council in facilitating and approving financial decisions critical to city development was highlighted.
- The grant from the Washington State Department of Commerce and the King County Flood Control District signifies substantial support toward urban forestry and flood control projects, respectively, showcasing the ongoing efforts to improve Seattle's infrastructure and environmental sustainability.
