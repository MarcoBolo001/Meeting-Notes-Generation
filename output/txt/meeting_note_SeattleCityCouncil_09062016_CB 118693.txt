Summary:
During the Seattle City Council meeting held on September 6, 2016, the main focus was the review of Council Bill 118693, which centers around amendments to the Seattle Municipal Code for development standards in the Ballard Hub Urban Village. The discussion was initiated by Speaker 1, providing a brief overview of the bill, emphasizing its intent to modify land use and zoning by amending sections 3.478.05 and 23.478.09. These amendments aim to adopt development standards that encourage a more vibrant, pedestrian-oriented commercial district within the Ballard Hub Urban Village. 

Councilmember Johnson, as Speaker 2, provided comprehensive details on the community engagement process leading up to these proposed changes, mentioning over two and a half years of public input from residents, businesses, the faith community, and nonprofits in Ballard. Special recognition was given to the Office of Planning Community Development and David Goldberg for their significant contributions, along with the Ballard Partnership for Smart Growth for their energy and collaboration in achieving these zoning changes. Speaker 2 clarified that the proposed amendments would not alter building heights but would encourage pedestrian-friendly development through specific requirements like parking location changes and the extension of pedestrian designation areas.

Attendees of the meeting, including Councilmember Johnson, Speaker 0, Sergeant Bagshaw, and President Harrell, participated in the roll call, ultimately passing the bill unanimously. This decision highlighted the council's support for the bill, reflecting the overwhelming positive public feedback received during the public hearing phase.

Notes:
- The bill specifically avoids altering height limits, focusing instead on promoting pedestrian-friendly urban development.
- The unanimous support for the bill's passage underscores the council's commitment to reflecting community desires for the Ballard Hub Urban Village's growth and development.
- This meeting serves as a significant step towards enhancing the Ballard area's appeal and functionality as a commercial and residential district, marking a milestone in Seattle's urban planning efforts.
