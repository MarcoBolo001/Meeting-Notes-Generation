Summary:
During the Seattle City Council meeting on December 14, 2015, key topics discussed included the confirmation of Mr. Strong, the presentation of the Public Utilities and Neighborhoods Committee's report, and the historic designation of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Globe. Council Bill 118 584, which proposed adding the Globe to the city's table of historical landmarks, was recommended for passage. The Globe, known for its emblematic significance and historical value, was highlighted by speakers for its connection to Seattle's history and journalism heritage. Councilmembers Gordon, Burgess, and Clarke, along with former councilmember Clark, were acknowledged for nominating the Globe for historic designation following its vacancy. Questions regarding the Globe's ownership and attachment to its current location were raised, with the Museum of History and Industry identified as the current owner. The bill was ultimately passed unanimously, marking a significant milestone in the city's efforts to preserve its historical landmarks.

Notes:
- The Globe was constructed in 1948, originally placed atop the pie building at Sixth Avenue and Wall Street.
- In 1986, the Globe was relocated to its present location on Elliott Avenue West.
- The Globe weighs approximately 18.5 tons and features neon signs and an eagle, symbolizing its importance to Seattle's journalistic history.
- The historic designation controls the Globe but not its steel base or the building it sits upon.
- Ownership has transitioned to the Museum of History and Industry, with discussions ongoing about its future location.
- The bill's passage reflects the council's commitment to preserving Seattle's cultural and historical assets.
