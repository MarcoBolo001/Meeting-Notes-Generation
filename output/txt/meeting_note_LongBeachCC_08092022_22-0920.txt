Summary:
The Long Beach City Council held a meeting to discuss and vote on an amendment to the Sales Tax Incentive Agreement with Ashland Corporation, associated with the expansion of the Circle Port and Aldi dealership located at 1855 North Lakewood Boulevard. The amendment aimed to extend the terms of the initial agreement, supporting a significant expansion project including a new showroom, parts and service department, and additional storage lot for the dealership.

Johnny Vallejo, acting director of economic development, provided a comprehensive report detailing the inception of the initial sales tax incentive agreement in 2011, its benefits to the city and the corporation, and the estimated outcomes of the proposed amendment. The amendment is expected to preserve 87 existing full-time jobs, create about 18 additional full-time jobs, and generate an estimated cumulative total of local sales tax over $10.1 million over ten years, of which $2.5 million will be allocated to the corporation, with the city profiting from the excess.

Council members and speakers discussed the importance of retaining iconic businesses within the city, highlighted the dealership's longstanding presence and contribution to Long Beach's economic landscape, and expressed unanimous support for the amendment proposal. Following deliberations, public comments, and council members' endorsements, a roll call vote was conducted, resulting in the unanimous passing of the motion to approve the amendment of the agreement.

The meeting provided an opportunity for open discussion among city council members, economic development officials, and the public, underscoring the city's commitment to economic renovation and support for local businesses. It demonstrated a strategic approach towards fostering economic growth, while ensuring the preservation and creation of job opportunities within the community.
