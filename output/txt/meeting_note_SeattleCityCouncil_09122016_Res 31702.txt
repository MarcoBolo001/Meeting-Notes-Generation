Summary:
The meeting commenced with Speaker 10 introducing Agenda Item 3, Resolution 31702, which supports Washington Initiative Measure 1491. This initiative aims to urge Seattle voters to vote in favor on the November 8th, 2016 general election ballot. The focus of the resolution and the initiative is to suspend a person's access to firearms if there is documented evidence of a threat of harm to themselves or others due to dangerous mental illness or a high risk of violent behavior.

Speaker 2 elaborated on the resolution, illustrating its significance in enhancing public safety by filling gaps in the current system that allow individuals undergoing crises or demonstrating violent behavior to possess and purchase firearms. The initiative is modeled after successful laws across the country and is based on the well-established system of protection orders in Washington state.

Further into the meeting, Councilman Burgess (Speaker 7) addressed the council, highlighting the common-sense nature of Measure 1491. He emphasized the prevalence of gun violence incidents involving suicide or unintentional shootings and how this initiative would allow family members to petition for a court-ordered seizure of firearms from individuals at great risk.

Public comments were solicited, during which Cynthia Lynette (Speaker 4), expressed concerns regarding the resolution's implications, specifically the mandatory psychiatric treatment and potential use of psychotropic drugs. Following public comments and further discussion, a vote was held, and the resolution passed.

Finally, Speaker 10 introduced the next item on the agenda, Resolution 31703, which similarly supports Washington Initiative Measure 1433 and encourages a positive vote in the upcoming general election.

Notes:
The meeting provided a detailed discourse on the purpose and implications of Resolution 31702 and Washington Initiative Measure 1491, elucidating the council's stance on gun safety and mental health. Public concerns highlighted the complexity of addressing gun safety measures, balancing the need for public safety with individual rights and healthcare practices. The passing of the resolution reinforces the council's commitment to implementing preventative measures to address gun violence, acknowledging the role of family and mental health in this endeavor.
