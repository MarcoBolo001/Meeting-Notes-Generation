Summary:
During the meeting, the main focus was on the approval of the Health and Human Services recommendation related to item 24. This entails authorizing the City Manager to execute all necessary documents with the Board of State and Community Corrections, enabling the acceptance and expenditure of $3.9 million in grant funding. This fund is allocated for the Long Beach Activating Safe Communities Program, aimed at enhancing citywide safety and wellbeing.

A public commentator expressed concerns regarding the distribution of the funds, particularly the allocation towards policing efforts. The commentator emphasized the need for a progressive approach towards creating safe communities, advocating for investments in education, social services, mental health counseling, and community building initiatives, rather than focusing predominantly on policing. They highlighted the importance of considering the community's perspective on what constitutes effective and adequate responses to safety and security issues.

Following the public comment, a roll call vote was conducted on the motion related to item 24. All present council members, including Vice Mayor Richardson, positively responded, leading to the motion being carried.

Notes:
The public commentator referenced the racial equity and reconciliation report, pointing out that it recommends looking to the community for insights on resolving issues. This underlines a crucial aspect of the discussion—ensuring that the initiatives funded by the grant genuinely reflect and address the community's needs and perspectives. The emphasis was on viewing safety not solely through the lens of policing but as a multifaceted issue requiring a diverse range of solutions, including but not limited to, improved healthcare, education reform, and social work programs.
