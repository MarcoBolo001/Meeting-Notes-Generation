Summary:
The meeting focused on the discussion and approval of Agenda Item two and three, relating to the full subdivision application by Kris Jolly and Council Bill 11857. Councilmember Johnson emphasized the interconnectedness of these items, both pertaining to a plot in the Uptown Queen Anne neighborhood, destined for the construction of 16 townhomes. The process outlined involves initial review by the Department of Construction and Inspections, a public hearing by the hearings examiner, and a final review to ensure the improvements match the preliminary plat. The council debated the procedural aspects, emphasizing the community's opportunity for comment and the administrative review requirements for developments exceeding ten units. Ultimately, the council moved to approve both the clerk file and Council Bill 118857, with all members voting in favor. This formal approval opens the way for the sale of the newly created townhome lots.
